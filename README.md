Chasing a Whale

Captain Ahab wants to get a sense of the strengths and limitations of various DNA sequence algorithms.
He encodes the text of Moby Dick into a DNA codon sequence.
He then splits this sequence into many fragments - as if the DNA really existed and was processed for sequencing.
Then he inputs these fragments into an NGS sequencing pipeline.
And when he gets back the reconstructed sequence, he decodes it to see how closely Moby Dick has been sequenced.
