Ahab's Whale
------------

1. Cat is just a file cat
2. doit.sh runs a confidence test before generating sample data
3. -r will go the other way with most filters
4. LookupFilter turns text into triplet sequence, at the moment with random assigned triplets
5. CutFilter snips the triplet sequence into random sized segments
6. ShuffleFilter and FastqShuffleFilter will randomize the sequence
7. Test Fastq by running FastqShuffleFilter -seq so there is no randomizing then -r to reverse it.
